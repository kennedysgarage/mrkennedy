                    <p>Weighing in at 195 pounds of pure muscle he is doing amazingly well. It has been just over two years now and you hardly tell with Jakes attitude. He is now officially retired from the Coast Guard (at 23) and taking it easy. Still on his daily regimen of 14 pills a day and at the gym 5 days a week. Going to school full time at Florida State College in Jacksonville, FL studying Aerospace Engineering. Thanks everyone for sending your love.</p>

                    <p>Today is a very important day for me and everyone around me. One year ago today I was in Mayo Clinic being rolled into the surgery room and being transplanted with a new liver which stopped the clock of death for me leaving this world at one day left on the clock. Today I am putting more weight up in the weight room and doing MMA, which has put me in my best shape ever and diet. I am doing the career path to be a pilot, which is what i wanted to do since I was 12. I am the happiest ever and had the best people around me to care for me by friends and family I am truly thankful for everything that they have done for me and I am in your debt thanks for keeping me alive whoever it is.</p>

In process he is no longer on the pain pump. The pathology report came back on his liver and it confirmed the failure of his liver was because of Budd-Chiari. They still do not have a reason why Budd-Chiari came into the picture. They said that there is a 50% change of them finding out. They said that he might be able to go home on Monday or Tuesday.</p>

Normal platelet counts are in the range of 150,000 to 400,000. They put a smaller neck IV in and they should be taking it out tomorrow. They also removed the JP drain. The plan of discharge as for now is Tuesday morning. Nothing but good news today. He is doing very well all the Doctors and Nurses love him.</p>

The Katie Walk, which was added in 2009, is another opportunity for you to tell the story, raise funds and have a good time with friends.

                    <p>Day 2 is normally the hardest day after surgery, it’s going to be a long one. We have some goals today: work out with his incentive spirometer and go for a walk. The incentive spirometer helps keep the lungs clear and active. We spent most of the night waking up to a very annoying beeping. Jake’s O2 was falling below 90, which can be normal for someone in his situation. Using the incentive spirometer will help with this, the bad part is it hurts to take full breaths after this type of surgery. We also want to get him out of bed and walk a few feet. This will not only help morale, it is the first step (no pun intended) to getting back to basic everyday functions. Jake is starting his day off with some strawberries for breakfast. He is in high spirits and ready for the long day.</p>

            <p>Dear Friends &amp; Family,
            <p>Wow, this has been a long day and it’s only 11:00pm. When we where all waiting on Jake’s new liver hours seemed like weeks. Now after his surgery is over time seems to be back to normal. Jake and his friends/family have all had a very stressful time dealing with something so random with no explanation. We are still waiting on results from his bone marrow biopsy and liver biopsy. Once we get these we will have a better understanding for the reasoning.<br/>
            <p>I want to give thanks to the countless emails and overwhelming response from everyone. Just to give you some stats about the website: there has been over 350 unique visitors to the site, 42 comments, 30 emails and 22 pictures contributed to the site for Jake. And the best part is, it’s been less than 24 hours sense the site went up. I have to give a special thanks to Meaghan, she has been at Jake’s side sense the beginning of this entire thing. She has gone out of her way to help Jake. When Jake needs something, she is there first to take on his needs. She is incredible to him. She has really made this a lot easier on everyone. I also have to think Paul, John and Brian who have been by his side and they have spent most of the nights with him. They have waited on him hand and feet. I also have to think his sister Amber and her husbands Kevin, they have been here a lot and put up with a lot. Jake loves his sister  very much and you can tell the wonderful bond they have for each other. She also help with making this site more legible. I have to include the countless people coming in and out all day long, to name a few Sean, Chin, everyone one from the Coast Guard, and I could go on forever. I can not even grasp how many people have come to see him. The last and most important thanks is to the Mayo Clinic and the entire staff. The wonderful team of Doctors that preformed this extremely dangerous surgery. The many nurses that have taken care of him, which most of them come by on their time off work to just check up on him. The techs and every other member of this magnificence place.<br/>
            <p>This is not over yet, both my speech and Jake’s recovery. Jake has several very difficult months ahead of him. We still need the love and support after today. In return we can offer to make several daily post. We will update you on everything that is happening. Jake wants to send out a very special thanks to everyone tomorrow. So look forward to that!<br/>
            <p>Thanks again to everyone, we all appreciates each others love. I know this has been a huge event in everyone life, including Jake’s. I don’t think I could ever express my full love to each of you out there. I am closing this with a hug, just the way Jake’s love to give them. Once again thank you so much.<br/>
            <p>Sincerely,<br/>
            Christopher Kennedy</p>

            <p>Jake is doing great. The docs said “he wanted hugs from everyone before he went under”. The nurse states that everything went great during the surgery. He didn’t even need blood. It was a perfect case for everyone. We will add a video here shortly. We have also added a new page, called “picture” go upload some pics of Jake or something tasteful to make him laugh. He is asking for hugs, so please send some hugs for him.</p>

                <h3>Jake Kennedy</h3>
                <p>Jake was admitted to the Mayo Clinic on January 29th, 2010 for acute liver failure. Three days later, after receiving excellent medical care and much love and support from his family and friends, we were informed that a donor had been found. The surgery went perfect and without any complications. He is now doing amazingly well. Jake is in great spirits and wants to thank everyone for their well wishes. He is now getting back to his weirdly awesome self.</p>
